          With eleven missing women to find and six high-profile burglary cases to solve, 
          the last thing Detective Nathan McNamara needs in his life is one more complication. And that's exactly what his recent one-night 
          stand is becoming-complicated. With his heinous lieutenant breathing down his neck for answers 
          and his accidental girlfriend dropping hints for a commitment, Nathan is realizing that his career 
          and his bachelor status are both on the line.

But this is easier said than done when the blonde from the bar repeatedly shows up at his doorstep and enlists his own mother against him. Now he's more convinced than ever that his job hangs in the balance and that the Surgeon General's warning on the whiskey bottle should include something about women.
                    The Detective is part of THE SOUL SUMMONER Series. Book one of the series is available on WATTPAD.
